Release: v1.00

Welcome to the Chromis

Chromis Kitchescr is the first of a range of new products under the Chromis banner.

The Kitchen screen software reads data from the pos softwares database. This was designed
to work in conjunction Unicenta. There is a requirement for a change in the Unicenta code 
for the application to function.

The initial screen displays 8 order panels and a list of any other orders in the system.


This kitchen screen software can be used with any pos software that is able to produce 
the correct table in the database and feed out the correct data.


Please follow installation instructions on how to install along side Unicenta oPos.
